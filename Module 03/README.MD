**Inheritance**

It's a way to factorize behaviors.
A class (derived) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (base).

### `protected`
New encapsulation level that will only be used for heritage. It's similar to `private`, but unlike `pritave`, it allows the derived classes to have access to the protected members while still denying access to them outside the class.
