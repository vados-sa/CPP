# CPP
42's introdutory modules on C++. -> In the making.

The exercises are done following the C++98 standart. Acording to the school, this is to keep things simple since C++ is a complex language.
The exercises progressively increase in complexity.

## Module 00
Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic
stuf.

### Namespaces
Namespaces are a way to organize code and prevent name conflicts in C++. They allow you to group related classes, functions, and variables under a single name. The std namespace is the standard namespace in C++ that includes all the standard library functions and classes, such as std::string and std::cout. -> "std::" is the namespace.
